## How It Works
At a high level, this extension uses the title of the movie/tv-show viewed by the user on prime video as input, sends that data to google s.e and takes the url of the first rotten-tomato web result found, and then searches rotten tomatoes for the correct audience rating/total scores, and then displays that back to the user. This all takes place client side; this extension does not collect user data. It is also completely free. Due to all the moving parts/dependence on external websites, this extension breaks frequently. If google, amazon prime, or rotten tomatoes has a page update, this extension will mostly likely need to, and be updated within 1-3 weeks.
